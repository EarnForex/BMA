# BMA

BMA is a simple Bands Moving Average indicator for MT4 and MT5 developed by EarnForex.com. All it does is applying the percentage bands to a classic moving average line (of any standard MetaTrader type - simple, exponential, smoothed, or linear-weighted).

It is a highly customizable indicator. Like traditional moving average it is displayed in the main window of the chart.

It can be used to measure percentage deviation of the exchange rate from its average value during the last N periods.
